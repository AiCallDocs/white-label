## Tips & Notes
- Keep one backup clone in case you need to switch voices quickly.
- Record in a quiet environment for the best quality.
- Use descriptive names (e.g., “Rafa_ES_Male”) if you manage multiple voices.

## Troubleshooting

**Probable Cause:** No sample uploaded/recorded or required fields missing.  
**Solution:** Ensure all fields are filled and a valid audio sample is provided.

**Symptom:** Cloned voice sounds distorted.  
**Probable Cause:** Poor recording quality or too much background noise.  
**Solution:** Re-record in a quieter space with a better microphone.
