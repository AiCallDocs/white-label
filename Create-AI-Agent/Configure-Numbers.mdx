## Overview

Use this page to connect phone numbers to the platform. You can:
- **Purchase** a new number (instant provisioning).
- **Import** existing numbers from **Twilio**.
- **Add a personal number** (verify caller ID for outbound).

The numbers list shows country, status (**Active**), and added date. Use the search bar to quickly find numbers. The trash icon removes a number from your account.

## Option 1 — Purchase a Number

- **Open:** `Purchase Number`.
- **Country:** Select the country where you need the number.
- **Number Type:**
  - **Local Number** – Standard local area code (typical choice).
  - **Toll-Free Number** – 800/888/… prefixes.
- **Area Code (Optional):** Enter a **3-digit** area code to filter (e.g., `415` for US).
- Click **Search Available Numbers** → choose one from the results.
- Review the **monthly price** shown (e.g., `$2.25/month` local, `$2.99/month` toll-free; varies by country).
- Click **Purchase Selected Number** to provision it.

> Notes  
> • Availability and pricing depend on country and area code.  
> • Numbers are billed monthly while active.  
> • After purchasing, the number appears in your list as **Active**.

## Option 2 — Import from Twilio

Bring numbers you already own in Twilio:

- **Open:** `Import from Twilio`.
- Enter your **Twilio Account SID** (starts with `AC…`) and **Auth Token**.
- Click **Search Twilio Numbers** to fetch your inventory.
- Select one or more numbers from **Your Twilio Numbers**.
- Click **Import Selected Number** to add them to your account.

> Tips  
> • Ensure your Twilio credentials are correct and have permission to read numbers.  
> • Imported numbers keep their country/capabilities (voice/SMS) as configured in Twilio.

## Option 3 — Add Personal Number (Outbound Caller ID)

Use your own phone as verified caller ID for **outbound** calls.

- **Open:** `Add Personal Number`.
- Enter your number in **E.164** format (e.g., `+14155550123`).
- **Verification process:**
  1. Submit your number.  
  2. You’ll receive a verification call.  
  3. Enter the code when prompted.  
  4. The number will be verified and added to your account.

> Notes  
> • This is for **outbound caller ID/return calls**, not for inbound routing.  
> • You must be able to answer the verification call to complete setup.

## Manage Numbers

- **Status:** Newly added numbers appear as **Active**.  
- **Delete:** Use the trash icon on a number card to remove it from your account.  
- **Search:** Use the top-right search box to filter by number.

> Best Practices  
> • Keep at least one **local** number per target region to improve pickup rates.  
> • Reserve toll-free for national campaigns or support lines.  
> • Name/label numbers consistently if your team manages multiple regions.
