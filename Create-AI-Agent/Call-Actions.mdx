## Overview
The **Call History** page lists all recent calls with key details and quick actions:
- Search by number, agent, or keyword.
- Filter by **date range** and **direction** (All / Inbound / Outbound).
- Open **transcripts**, **recordings**, and **extracted data**; export results to **CSV**.

> **Note:** To access **recordings**, **transcripts**, and **extracted data**, call recording must be **enabled** for the agent.

---

## Filters & Search
- **Search calls…** – Free text search (number, agent, etc.).
- **Date range** – e.g., *7 Days* (customizable).
- **Direction** – *All / Inbound / Outbound*.
- **More Filters** – Additional filters when available.
- **Export CSV** – Exports the current filtered view.

---

## Table Columns
- **Start Date/Time** – When the call started (local time).
- **Direction** – *Inbound* or *Outbound*.
- **Agent Name** – The agent that handled the call.
- **Agent Type** – e.g., *Standard AI* (or other types you configure).
- **Phone Number** – Counterparty number.
- **Call Duration** – HH:MM length.
- **Call Origin** – Source of the call (e.g., application).
- **Status** – Final outcome (e.g., *Completed*).
- **Machine** – Whether an answering machine was detected.
- **Appointment** – Shows *Yes/No* if a booking was created during the call.
- **Extracted Data** – Indicates if entities were captured from the transcript.

---

## Row Actions
Each call row provides quick actions on the right:
- **Transcript** – Opens the full conversation transcript in a modal.
- **Recording** – Play/download the audio recording.
- **Extracted Data** – View structured entities (e.g., appointment date, name, intent).  
  > Entities come from your **Data Extraction Configuration** set in the agent.

---

## Export & Pagination
- Use **Export CSV** to download the current filtered results.
- Control **Rows per page** and navigate with **Prev/Next**.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **No transcript/recording shown:** Verify **Record calls** is enabled for that agent.
- **Extracted Data empty:** Ensure the agent has **Data Extraction** entities configured and the call content matched those rules.
- **Missing appointments:** Confirm **Schedule Appointments** is enabled and the calendar is correctly selected in the agent.
