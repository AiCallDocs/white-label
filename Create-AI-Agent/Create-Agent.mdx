## Step 1: Basic Information

Begin by entering the core settings for your agent:

- **Agent Name**  
  Internal name used to identify your agent in the platform.

- **Agent Type**
  - **Inbound** – Handles incoming calls to your number.  
  - **Outbound** – Makes calls to your contacts.

- **Maximum Call Duration**  
  Time limit per call (allowed range: **1–30 minutes**). Use lower values for triage or high-volume flows.

- **Intelligence Type**
  - **Standard AI** – Uses general AI knowledge for conversations.  
  - **Knowledge-Based** – Uses your uploaded documents to answer domain-specific questions.

- **Optional Call Settings**
  - **Enable answering machine detection** – Detects voicemail/answering machines.  
  - **Add office background ambience** – Subtle noise to sound more natural.  
  - **Record calls** – Required to access **transcriptions**, **recordings**, and **extracted data**.  
    > If disabled, transcripts/recordings and any extracted entities won’t be available.

- **Retry Attempts & Delay**
  - **Retry Count** – Number of retry attempts if the call fails (e.g., **0** by default).  
  - **Retry Delay (minutes)** – Time between retries (e.g., **30** by default).

- **Welcome Prompt Delay (ms)**  
  Delay before playing the initial greeting (e.g., **1000 ms** for a natural pause).

- **Webhook URL (Optional)**  
  Endpoint to receive **call events** and **transcripts** in real time. Ensure it returns **200 OK**.

## Step 2: Voice & Language

Configure language and voice so your agent sounds right for the use case:

- **Language** – Primary conversation language (e.g., English, Spanish, etc.).  
- **Audio Speed** – Slider to set **Slow / Normal / Fast** pacing.  
- **Voices** – Choose from **Default Voices** (male/female options) or **Cloned Voices**.  
- **Preview** – Use the play icon to audition a voice before saving.

> Tip: Keep speed at *Normal* for booking/sales flows; increase slightly only if users are impatient or scripts are short.

## Step 3: Prompts & Behavior

Define how the agent greets, behaves, and extracts information:

- **Category**  
  Select the category that best matches your use case.

- **Greeting Message**  
  First sentence the caller hears when the call connects. Keep it short, friendly, and on-brand.

- **Conversation Prompt**  
  Detailed instructions that set **role**, **tone**, **policy boundaries**, and **objectives**.  
  Include guidance for tricky cases (e.g., rescheduling, objections, emergencies).

- **Available Variables**  
  Use dynamic tags to personalize content. Examples seen in the UI include:  
  `[address]`, `[agent_name]`, `[amount]`, `[appointment_date]`, `[appointment_type]`, `[city]`,  
  `[company_name]`, `[contact_name]`, `[date]`, `[email]`, `[first_name]`, `[name]`,  
  `[product_name]`, `[state]`, `[time_of_day]`, `[zipcode]`.  
  > Variables are replaced at runtime. Unknown tags resolve to empty values.

## Step 4: Call Actions & Data Extraction

Make your agent actually do things (schedule, handoff) and capture structured data:

- **Call Actions**
  - **Schedule Appointments** – Enables booking flows.  
  - **Forward to Human** – Transfers the call when escalation is required.

- **Calendar Integration (Google Calendar)**  
  Choose the account and specific calendar used for **availability checks** and **booking**.  
  Events from the **selected** calendar are respected when scheduling.

- **Data Extraction Configuration**
  - Define **entities** you want to capture from the conversation (name + definition).  
    Example:  
    - **Entity:** `Appointment`  
      **Definition:** “Extract appointment details (date/time) from the transcript.”  
  - Extracted entities appear in call reports and can be used by integrations.

**Save Changes** to activate your agent and start using it.
