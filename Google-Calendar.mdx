## Overview

Connect your Google Calendar so agents can **check availability** and **book appointments** directly during calls.\
Setup happens in **Actions → Google Calendar** and then is **enabled per agent**.

---

## Prerequisites

- A Google account with Calendar enabled.
- Access to **Actions → Google Calendar** in the platform.
- (Optional) Recording enabled if you rely on transcripts/extracted data elsewhere.

---

## Step 1 — Connect Google Calendar (Actions)

1. Go to **Actions → Google Calendar** and click **Add Account** (or **Connect**).
2. Select the Google account and grant the requested permissions.
3. In the **Appointments** tab, choose the **calendar** that will be used for availability checks and bookings.

> You can connect multiple accounts and switch the selected calendar at any time.

---

## Step 2 — Appointment Action (required)

Open the **Appointment Action** tab and complete the required fields:

- **Appointment Title** _(required)_ — Title used when creating events.
- **Description** _(optional)_ — Context for the booked meeting.
- **Timezone** _(required)_ — Timezone applied to all appointments.
- **Working Hours** — Define the time ranges when booking is allowed.

> **Important:** If **Appointment Title** or **Timezone** are not set, **the agent will not book or log appointments correctly**.

---

## Step 3 — Enable Scheduling in the Agent

1. Edit your agent and go to **Call Actions**.
2. Toggle **Schedule Appointments** to **On**.
3. In **Google Calendar Integration**, select the **connected account** and **calendar** you configured in Actions.
4. Save your changes.

---

## Usage

- During a call, the agent proposes times within your **Working Hours** and books on the **selected calendar**.
- Existing events on that calendar are treated as **busy** and won’t be double-booked.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **No event created?** Check that **Appointment Title** and **Timezone** are set in **Appointment Action**.
- **Agent says it can’t schedule:** Ensure **Schedule Appointments** is enabled and a **calendar** is selected in the agent.
- **Availability looks wrong:** Verify the correct **calendar** is selected and **Working Hours** reflect your real schedule.
- **Permissions changed:** Reconnect the Google account in **Actions → Google Calendar**.

**Tip:** Keep one dedicated “Bookings” calendar to avoid mixing personal events with call-scheduled appointments.
