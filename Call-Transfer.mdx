## Overview
Use **Call Transfer** to route an active call from your AI agent to a human representative.  
Transfers are managed through configurations that group one or more transfer details.

## Steps

### 1. Create a Transfer Configuration
1. Open **Call Transfer** settings.
2. Click **Create Configuration**.
3. Fill in:
   - **Configuration Name** — Internal name for this transfer setup.
   - **Department Name** — The department the calls will be routed to.
4. In **Transfer Details**, click **Add Transfer Detail**.

---

### 2. Add Transfer Details
1. Fill in:
   - **Agent Name** — Must be set to `default` for the transfer to work.
   - **Transfer Number** — Destination phone number in E.164 format (e.g., +34642802285).
   - **Transfer Message** — Short message played before the transfer (e.g., “Please hold while we connect you with our sales representative”).
2. Save the transfer detail.
3. You can add multiple transfer details if needed.

---

### 3. Edit or Manage Configurations
- Use the pencil icon to edit transfer details.
- Use the trash icon to remove a detail.
- Changes are saved per configuration.

---

### 4. Assign a Transfer Configuration to an Agent
1. Edit your AI agent.
2. In **Call Actions**, enable **Forward to Human**.
3. Select the transfer configuration you created.
4. Save the agent.

## Tips & Notes
- **Agent Name must be `default`** for the transfer to trigger correctly.
- Include a clear, polite transfer message so the caller knows what is happening.
- You can set up multiple configurations for different departments and select them per agent.

## Troubleshooting
**Symptom:** Transfer doesn’t happen.  
**Probable Cause:** Agent Name is not set to `default` or number is not in E.164 format.  
**Solution:** Correct the Agent Name and phone number format.

**Symptom:** Caller is disconnected instead of transferred.  
**Probable Cause:** Invalid destination number or network restrictions.  
**Solution:** Test the number manually before assigning it.
